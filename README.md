# Walking-Using-Genetic-Algorithm-in-Processing

For a project at GHP, my partner and I made a genetic algorithm to make a collection of nodes and muscles walk. I contributed most of the code base, but we didn't use a lot of it.
It only kind-of works. It's a work in progess.

## Dependencies
Needs to be run in processing. I wouldn't have used it, but my partner was familiar with it, so that's what we used.
